This is the dataset from last year. The structure is a little different.

- There are 4 classes, instead of 3: shoot, seed, root, occluded_root. Ignore the occluded root class.

- The naming is different but should not matter for you. The idea is the same:
image name: abcd.png
corresponding mask names: abcd_root_mask.tif, abcd_shoot_mask.tif, abcd_shoot_mask.tif
