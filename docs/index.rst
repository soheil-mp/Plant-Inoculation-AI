Welcome to Plant Inoculation AI, an AI-powered automated plant root inoculation system that combines computer vision, deep learning, and robotics to precisely target and inoculate plant root tips.

Features
--------

ðŸ”¬ **Computer Vision Pipeline**
  - Petri dish detection and extraction
  - Plant instance segmentation using traditional CV
  - Deep learning segmentation with U-Net + MobileNet
  - Root architecture analysis and skeletonization
  - Precise root tip detection for robotic targeting

ðŸ¤– **Robotics & Control**
  - OT-2 robot simulation using PyBullet
  - PID controllers with anti-windup protection
  - Reinforcement learning with SAC algorithm
  - Hybrid control blending PID and RL approaches
  - Sub-millimeter precision targeting

ðŸ§  **Machine Learning**
  - Custom U-Net architecture with multi-loss optimization
  - Mixed precision training for GPU acceleration
  - Transfer learning with pre-trained MobileNet
  - Real-time inference with patch-based processing

Quick Start
-----------

Installation::

    # Install with Poetry (recommended)
    poetry install
    
    # For GPU support
    poetry install --extras gpu
    
    # Install everything
    poetry install --extras all

Basic Usage::

    from plant_inoculation_ai import CVPipeline, PIDController
    
    # Initialize computer vision pipeline
    pipeline = CVPipeline(patch_size=960)
    
    # Process plant image
    results = pipeline.process_image("plant_image.jpg")
    
    # Initialize robot controller
    controller = PIDController(
        kp=[1.0, 1.0, 1.0],
        ki=[0.1, 0.1, 0.1], 
        kd=[0.05, 0.05, 0.05]
    )
